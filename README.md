# My Personal Blog

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zaccc123/zaccc123.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zaccc123/zaccc123.github.io)

Hi, I'm Zac, a Maker üë®‚Äçüíª, Full Stack Dev, Tech Lead, Maker of http://flymusca.com

I have worked as a mobile engineer(iOS), backend Engineer (python) and now as a Technical Lead. I enjoy building my own product at night and whenever I am free.

I like to ensure that all my project is set up with continuous integration. Therefore, I make a [Musca](http://flymusca.com) - a mac taskbar app that keeps track of you Github Commit statuses.

You can find me on twitter [@Zaccc123](https://twitter.com/Zaccc123/)!
